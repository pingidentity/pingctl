release:
  # If set to auto, will mark the release as not ready for production
  # in case there is an indicator for this in the tag e.g. v1.0.0-rc1
  # If set to true, will mark the release as not ready for production.
  # Default is false.
  prerelease: auto

  # If set to false, will NOT mark the release as "latest".
  # This prevents it from being shown at the top of the release list,
  # and from being returned when calling https://api.github.com/repos/OWNER/REPO/releases/latest.
  #
  # Available only for GitHub.
  #
  # Default is true.
  # Since: v1.20
  make_latest: true

  # What to do with the release notes in case there the release already exists.
  #
  # Valid options are:
  # - `keep-existing`: keep the existing notes
  # - `append`: append the current release notes to the existing notes
  # - `prepend`: prepend the current release notes to the existing notes
  # - `replace`: replace existing notes
